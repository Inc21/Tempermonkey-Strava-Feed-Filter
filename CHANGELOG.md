## [v2.3.1] - 26.10.2025 (Userscript)

### Added

- Safari iOS–compatible userscript: `userscript/sff-safari.user.js`
- New filter: Hide activities tagged as "Commute"
- External service embeds: Added Wandrer to the hide list
- Preference to show/hide the "Give Kudos to Everyone" button; synced visibility for secondary nav button on smaller screens

### Changed

- Minor responsive/UI tweaks for the settings panel and secondary navigation

---

## [v1.2.5] - 29.09.2025

### Fixed

- Firefox Extension (Desktop & Android)
  - "Give Kudos to Everyone" header button now displays immediately on first load when enabled. The initialization now calls `manageHeaderKudosButton()` during dashboard startup in `firefox-extension/content/injected.js`.
  - ON/OFF toolbar badge now reflects the saved state on browser startup without opening the popup. Implemented `firefox-extension/background.js` and wired it in the manifest.

### Changed

- Firefox manifest now uses `background.scripts` (instead of `background.service_worker`) to support temporary add-on installation during development.
- Dashboard `<body>` is marked with `data-sff-dashboard` on init to ensure responsive CSS applies immediately.
- Minor stability and synchronization improvements for secondary kudos button visibility.

## [v2.2.5] - 29.09.2025 (Chrome)

### Added

- **Complete feature parity with Firefox extension**:
  - Full filter UI panel with all sections (keywords, allowed athletes, activity types, distance/duration/elevation/pace ranges, map filtering, section hiding, external embeds filtering)
  - Draggable panel with position memory and responsive design
  - Secondary navigation for smaller screens with filter and kudos buttons
  - "Give Kudos to Everyone" header button with first-load visibility when enabled
  - Real-time activity counting and filter result updates
  - Unit system toggle (Metric/Imperial) with proper conversions
  - Auto-filtering with MutationObserver and scroll debounce
  - SPA navigation handling and page change detection
  - Popup toggle updates badge and notifies content script
  - Background script initializes and maintains badge state

### Technical Details

- Cross-browser compatibility layer using `ext` shim for Chrome/Firefox APIs
- Message passing between popup and content script for real-time updates
- Complete CSS injection with responsive breakpoints and secondary nav support

    reports from activity descriptions

  "Hide your challenges" for better clarity and now targets the specific
  "Your Challenges" section instead of individual challenge activities
