# Strava Feed Filter

A Tampermonkey script to filter your Strava feed and hide activities you don't want to see.

## Description

This script enhances your Strava experience by providing powerful filtering capabilities directly on your feed. You can hide activities based on keywords, activity type, distance, duration, elevation, and more. The script adds a convenient, draggable panel to the Strava dashboard to configure your filtering preferences.

## Current Features

- **Keyword Filtering**: Hide activities containing specific keywords in their title or description.
- **Activity Type Filtering**: Show or hide specific types of activities (e.g., Ride, Run, VirtualRide, Walk, etc.).
- **Data-based Filtering**:
  - Filter by distance (min/max).
  - Filter by duration (min/max).
  - Filter by elevation gain (min/max).
- **Pace Filtering**: Filter runs based on their pace.
- **Map Filtering**: Hide activities that do not have a map.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - A draggable settings panel to easily toggle filters.
  - Settings are saved locally in your browser, so they persist between sessions.
- **Support the developer**: Includes a "Buy Me a Coffee" link.

## Future Features

This script is under active development. Future enhancements may include:

- More advanced filtering options.
- Improved UI/UX.
- ... and more!
